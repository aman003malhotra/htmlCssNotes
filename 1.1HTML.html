        <h3>The difference between strong and b </h3>
        <p>Bold is a style when you say "bold a word" people, basically know that it means to add more, let's say "ink" around 
            the letters until they stand out more amongst the rest of the letters.
        </p>
        <p>
            strong however is an indication of how something should be understood. i is stylistic only and em put emphasis on the text

        <ul>
            <li>Search engine will consider its contents as important keywords to influence search rankings</li>
            <li>Screen reader can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page</li>
            <li>Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or 
                without sematics.
            </li>
